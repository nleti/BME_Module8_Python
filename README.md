We created a game that takes place inside the human blood vessel where you play as a white blood cell in human form. 
You travel through the bloodstream, protecting the body and eliminating harmful pathogens.
Your main goal is to defeat the adenoviruses. Along the way, there are different obstacles you have to deal with such
as blood clots which have been forming due to the adenovirus, blocking your path and making it harder to move through
the blood vessels. You have to get past these challenges and eliminate all the viruses.

The level has some minor bugs related to the map layout. However, working with Tiled is time-consuming,
and due to time constraints, we left it in its current state.
